# Movie API

This is the server-side component of the "myFlix" web application. The web application will provide users with access to information about different movies, directors, genres, and actors. Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.

**The Movie API is a REST API built with:**
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB
- Mongoose

**It further includes:**
- User authentication and authorization (basic HTTP authentication and JWT authentication with Passport)
- Data security and validation logic (CORS, password hashing with bcrypt, server-side input validation with express-validator)
- Logging with Morgan

The API is deployed to Heroku.
